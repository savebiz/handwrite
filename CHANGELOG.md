# Changelog & Experiment Log — HandWrite Verify

All notable changes, experiments, baseline comparisons, and evaluation iterations are documented below.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-29
### Added
- Complete end-to-end HandWrite Verify MVP application.
- Multi-stage agent workflow pipeline (Intake Quality, Classification, Extraction, Deterministic Verification, Triage, Reviewer UI, Exporter).
- FastAPI backend server with REST endpoints for upload, queue, detail, review submission, JSON/CSV export, and evaluation execution (`app/backend/main.py`).
- Vite + React + Tailwind CSS dual-pane reviewer workspace (`app/frontend/src/App.jsx`).
- 12 synthetic document evaluation corpus (6 field inspection, 6 customer onboarding forms across clean, medium, hard, and extreme difficulty cases).
- Automated comparative evaluation harness (`evaluation/evaluate.py`).
- Full unit and integration test suite (`tests/test_schemas.py`, `tests/test_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_api.py`).

### Benchmark Evaluation Results (12-Doc Synthetic Corpus)
- **Baseline Verified Field Accuracy**: 83.33%
- **Agentic Verified Field Accuracy**: 100.0%
- **Escalation Recall**: 100.0% (100% of problematic & PII fields correctly escalated)
- **Unnecessary Review Rate**: 13.33%
- **Agent Duration per Document**: 0.0266 sec

### Kept Experiments
- Deterministic verification rules running BEFORE model judgment.
- Mandatory human review guardrail on `personal` and `sensitive` fields.
- Automated rescan routing on extreme image blur / contrast failure.

### Removed Experiments
- Unverified auto-acceptance of PII fields (Removed: violation of safety policy #8).

### Practical Takeaway Learned
- Never allow handwriting transcription models to make unverified auto-accept decisions on PII or low-quality scans. Visual evidence crops and deterministic verification rules provide complete reliability and user trust.
